5.  Comments about any of the above elements for evaluating trees? Are there elements missing from this list that you would want with a tree?
Text Response,
"Nuber of loci used
Protein or non-protein markers
Number of characters
Ambiguos regions included or nor included
",
"Alignments are often ""filtered"" using a program, eg Gblocks. This filtering step can be critical in the production of the alignement to be used, and should be listed as well. ",
"Diversity of methods, do not stick only to one",
"For time-calibrated trees, confidence intervals as well as calibration information (what fossils were used, what molecular rate was used) seem important because they greatly influence the results and their interpretation along with the confidence one puts into the results.",
"Ideally, any external researcher should be able of reproducing the same tree given the same initial information. Everything necessary for this should be made available for interested researchers",
"'- alignment quality evaluation by dedicated programme
- site selection for the phylogeny reconstruction and method/approach used",
"1) The model used in reconstruction is critical for me (GTR, I, Dollo, ...), its parameters are useful.
2) Not sure what you mean by ""Full list of samples used to calculate support values"". I normally don't use existing bootstrap datasets/plateau data, but would produce them myself if they are needed.
3) Are you considering networks, too?",
"In the instance of ML, what model was used and how it was determined that it was appropriate.",
"If relative or absolute dates are reported, elements related to these estimates should be included.",
"Most problems I see in trees are due to input data and alignment issues, but most reviewers focus on methods (maximun likelihood vs neighbor-joining, requesting bootstrap etc).  ",
All of the above information is important to be included in the respective publication.  Not all of it need to be depicted on the specific tree.,
It is not uncommon to find an article that makes the phylogenetic data available in pdf format.  This is useful for viewing a tree but almost useless for analyzing a tree with software.    Phylogenetic data should be made available in nexus or newick format.,
"For provenance metadata, the impending W3C PROV ontology should perhaps be used to express it.  http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/
More generally of course standard metadata ontologies should be used wherever reasonable.",
"taxonomic names of internal nodes (clades)
phylogenetic definitions of names (internal and leaf)",
Highest priority is what makes the tree reproducible because if I can reproduce it (even if I don't) then I know everything I need to interpret it.,
The context of use dictates the granularity of information required. Some use cases don't require all the critical information. ,
"Information about why they chose the phylogenetic method in questions. That is, did they perform model testing? Obviously this is only possible for smaller data sets very large data would just use RAxML or FastTree.",
"This survey wasnt clear as to whether the data above should be ON THE TREE (or caption) or somewhere on the poliblucation (materials and methods), or even in sequence metadata (genbank). I answered the above as though it referred to data availability in general, as long as the data are available. 

A field I would add: how sequences are clustered on the tree (OTUs, or grouped by taxon level, etc) and how this was done. I have yet to see a publication fail to mention this, but it is very important to include. ",
"Links both to sequence and taxonomy databases

Overall this looks really good and will help the field a lot if adopted.",
"Opinion of the author of the tree about it's degree of accuracy: something more personal than support values, and at a meta level.",
"When calculated using parsimony, L, Ci and Ri are critical, as well as the weighting scheme.",
"This question is ambiguous: ""The source of biological material (tissue, specimen, etc) for data at the tips"". It is critically important that there ultimately be a way to trace the tip of the tree to a specific specimen or observation record. ",
No,
"Tip labels should be not just informative, but should identify tip specimen to at least species level, with species author.",

7.  Comments about providing any of the above elements when databasing / archiving trees? Are there elements missing from the list that you would want to provide?
Text Response,
"Same comment as above : Alignments are often ""filtered"" using a program, eg Gblocks. This filtering step can be critical in the production of the alignement to be used, and should be listed as well. ",
"As it often depends on context, the decisions appear partly hard to generalize from",
The ratings will depend on the software you use and your personal data management.,
"It's really impossible to answer those questions the same for all data types.  For a radily evolving and globally spreading virus, the date is critical and location perhaps not useful.  For some bacteria and viruses, the host or tissue type of sample is important.  For plants the elevation might be critical, or depth of sample in the ocean.
For all, providing the actual sequence alignment used, and having that alignment provide links to the database (CenBank accession number, for example) is the best way to go.  Providing all the information in tip labels is too much for drawing most trees to publication size and quality.",
"I don't do any publishing or archiving, but if I did, all of them would be ""Easy"".  For archiving, and probably for publishing, these questions are not about the metadata items. They are about the strength of the programmer who has to implement them.  At worst, the work would be unambiguously publishing the metadata, which is difficult only if there are hidden semantic linkages between the metadata. Without knowing about that---which I don't---probably no answers to this section are reliable.",
"I don't really know what ""Full list of samples used to calculate support values"" means.",
for some of the items the answer is 'it depends' - I marked them medium,
Some of us still use our eyes (and no algorithms) to align sequences. ,
"Ones labeled medium may be difficult, depending on size of tree.",
"specimen metadata is easy when its your own data. The issue is provding that for other, genbank sourced data included in the analysis. Genbank metadata is, and always has been, lacking standards and poorly managed.",
"Geographic coordinates are many times impossible for microbiological samples, such as type strains. Metagenomic analysis would make the first two questions near impossible to completely comply with, if required for each tip. Also, visualization of the entire tree of 10,000 becomes problematic; therefore, text labels would not work.",
"Linking tips to a database could be quite easy if the database exists, but I belive would currently require creating a database entry.  This 
Much of the alignment and tree building parameter information will be lost for older trees, but easy to gather for new analyses.  It is important for scientists to realize the importance of saving parameters and tracking versions. ",
The ease of inputting these data depends entirely on the author's bioinformatics skill. Most of these data can easily be extracted from a properly maintained sequence database (eg. Arb). ,
Name and contact info for person who made the tree and the PI,
"Many information cannot really be standardised, because you will encounter exceptions that don't fit in the format decided by the standardisation committee.",
